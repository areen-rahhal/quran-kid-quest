# Rules for AI

These rules get shown to the AI on all chats and Command sessions.

**use simple and easy-to-understand language.**

## Fundamental Principles

-   Write clean, simple, readable code
-   Reliability is the top priority -- if you can't make it reliable,
    don't build it
-   Implement features in the simplest possible way
-   Keep files small and focused (\<200 lines)
-   Test after every meaningful change
-   Focus on core functionality before optimization
-   Use clear, consistent naming
-   Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2--3 reasoning paragraphs.
-   Leave ego aside when debugging and fixing errors. You do not know
    anything.
-   When fixing bugs, leave the ego at the door and DO NOT assume you've
    already understood the user's problem or the root cause.
-   Do not assume you have the latest up-to-date information. In fact,
    you should verify dependencies, versions, and documentation before
    making changes.


## Error Fixing Rules 

-   Consider multiple possible causes before deciding. Do not jump to
    conclusions.
-   Explain the problem in plain English
-   When fixing bugs, leave the ego at the door and DO NOT assume you've
    already understood the user's problem or the root cause.
-   Do not assume you have the latest up-to-date information. In fact,
    you should verify dependencies, versions, and documentation before
    making changes.
-   Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as
    possible
-   Always verify the fix
-   In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web
    search to find the latest up-to-date information

## ERROR FIXING PROCESS

*(follow this process every time you are fixing an error)*

-   **STEP 1:** EXPLAIN what you think the error is IN PLAIN ENGLISH\
-   **STEP 2:** Fix the error, while changing as few lines of code as
    possible\
-   **STEP 3:** TELL ME HOW TO TEST THIS FIX

**FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER. DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS!!**

## Building Process

-   Understand requirements completely before starting
-   Plan the next steps in detail

*(follow this process when you're adding new features or making
changes)*

-   **STEP 1:** ANSWER ALL OF THE USER'S QUESTIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS,
    fully and completely before beginning any implementation.\
-   **STEP 2:** WRITE TWO DETAILED PARAGRAPHS thinking and reasoning
    about what needs to be built, trade-offs, and acceptance criteria.\
-   **STEP 3:** LIST OUT THE REMAINING NECESSARY STEPS (if any), and
    choose which ones are highest priority and estimate effort.\
-   **STEP 4:** WRITE THE CODE for the current step ONLY!!\
-   **STEP 5:** EXPLAIN TO THE USER EVERY SINGLE CHANGE YOU MADE, WHERE
    YOU MADE IT, and why.\
-   **STEP 6:** GIVE USER CONCISE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO TEST THE NEW
    FEATURE

**FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER. DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS!!**

## GITHUB PUSH PROCESS

*(follow these steps IN ORDER anytime the user wants to push)*

-   **STEP 1:** Inside of a code block, write the commit message for the
    user, clear, concise, and following our conventional commit format.

**FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER. DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS!!**
